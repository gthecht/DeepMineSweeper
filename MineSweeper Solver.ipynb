    "# Training a Convolutional Neural Network to solve minesweeper\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "I wanted to learn a bit of tensorflow, and also to solve the minesweeper problem. At first, (a year ago), I thought to use basic machine learning, but didnâ€™t succeed because I barely knew how to do anything.\n",
    "The idea was to train a network, that gets a partially open board and tries to predict where the mines are on the board.\n",
    "We then use this network to look at the game-board and find the square with the least likelihood of being a mine. We then open it and predict once more on the updated game-board, and so on.\n",
